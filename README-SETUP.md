# Hospital Sustainability Dashboard

## 🏥 Complete Setup Guide

You now have a fully functional **React 18 + Next.js 14** hospital sustainability dashboard with:

### ✅ Features Implemented:

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) - View all 8 hospitals, metrics, trends
2. **Department Dashboard** (`/department/dashboard`) - Individual hospital data entry
3. **Supabase Integration** - Authentication, database, RLS
4. **TypeScript** throughout
5. **Modern UI Components** with Tailwind CSS

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Test Your Input Fields First**

Visit `http://localhost:3000/test-form` to verify all input fields work:

- ✅ Name field should accept typing
- ✅ Email field should accept typing
- ✅ Password field should accept typing

If inputs don't work, we need to fix this first before proceeding.

### 2. **Set Up Database**

1. **Go to** [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. **Open SQL Editor** in your project
3. **Copy and run** the entire contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. **This creates:**
   - 8 hospitals
   - Proper RLS policies
   - User profile system
   - Entry tracking

### 3. **Create Test Users**

**Admin User:**

1. Sign up at `/login` with: `admin@hospital.com`
2. After signup, run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles
   SET role = 'admin', hospital_id = NULL
   WHERE email = 'admin@hospital.com';
   ```

**Department Head Users:**

1. Sign up with emails like: `head1@hospital.com`, `head2@hospital.com`, etc.
2. Assign them to hospitals:

   ```sql
   -- Get hospital IDs first
   SELECT id, name FROM hospitals;

   -- Assign users to hospitals
   UPDATE profiles
   SET role = 'department_head', hospital_id = 'HOSPITAL_ID_HERE'
   WHERE email = 'head1@hospital.com';
   ```

### 4. **Test the Dashboards**

**Admin Dashboard:** `/admin/dashboard`

- View all 8 hospitals
- See submission status
- Send reminders
- View trends and outliers

**Department Dashboard:** `/department/dashboard`

- Enter monthly metrics
- Save drafts or submit final
- Export CSV data
- View 12-month trends

## 🎯 Testing Workflow

1. **Fix input fields** (if needed) at `/test-form`
2. **Sign up as admin** → access `/admin/dashboard`
3. **Sign up as department heads** → access `/department/dashboard`
4. **Enter sample data** through department dashboards
5. **View aggregated data** in admin dashboard
